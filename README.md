# ConvoAppDPS
school final project
   
convoapp is the main project and changes are to be made there.
lanconvoapp is my previous attempt. It forgoes the convenctional filestream.read/write(obj) and uses
string buffers . It also contains completed methods for the chat room class and user class .
As of now all methods of the user class have been modified and integrated into convoapp from lanconvoapp

Update 12.1
